# Quick Start Guide - ARC-AGI-2 DSL Solver

Get started in 5 minutes with the training-based approach!

## ⚡ Fastest Path to Results

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/CHRISILDAVID/ARC_DSL.git
cd ARC_DSL

# Run the complete training pipeline
python3 train_dsl_model.py

# This creates:
# - final_trained_programs.json (all learned programs)
# - final_train_submission.json (training predictions)
```

**That's it!** You've trained DSL programs on all 1000 tasks.

## 📊 What You Get

After training, you'll see:
```
Training complete!
  Solved: 391/1000 (39.1%)
  Average accuracy: 39.1%
  Methods used:
    prebuilt: 390
    simple_transform: 1
    none: 609
```

This means:
- ✅ **391 tasks** solved with **100% accuracy**
- ⚠️ **609 tasks** return zero grids (need improvement)

## 🎯 Generate Kaggle Submission

```bash
# Generate predictions for evaluation data
python3 test_dsl_model.py \
    --trained-programs final_trained_programs.json \
    --split evaluation \
    --output submission.json

# Upload submission.json to Kaggle!
```

## 📓 Using Jupyter Notebook

```bash
# Open the notebook
jupyter notebook llm_dsl_solver.ipynb

# Run these cells in order:
# 1. Configuration (set paths)
# 2. Install Dependencies
# 3. Load DSL Module
# 4. Scroll to "Training-Based DSL Program Synthesis"
# 5. Run all training cells
# 6. Run submission generation cell
```

## 🔍 Test on Small Sample First

```bash
# Test on just 10 tasks (30 seconds)
python3 train_dsl_model.py --limit 10

# Test on 100 tasks (2 minutes)
python3 train_dsl_model.py --limit 100
```

## 📁 Key Files

After running, you'll have:

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `final_trained_programs.json` | All learned programs | ~4 MB |
| `final_train_submission.json` | Training predictions | ~6 MB |
| `final_evaluation_submission.json` | Evaluation predictions | ~2 MB |

## 🚀 Full Pipeline Script

For complete automation:

```bash
# Run everything in one command
./run_training_pipeline.sh

# Or with custom data path
./run_training_pipeline.sh /path/to/ARC-AGI-2-main/data
```

This script:
1. Trains on 1000 training tasks
2. Validates on training data
3. Generates evaluation predictions
4. Creates all submission files

## 💡 Understanding Results

### Solved Tasks (39.1%)
- Use pre-built DSL solvers from `solvers.py`
- Achieve **100% accuracy** on training examples
- Generate valid predictions for test cases

### Unsolved Tasks (60.9%)
- No matching DSL program found
- Return **zero grids** as placeholder
- Opportunities for improvement:
  - Add more synthesis strategies
  - Use LLM for complex cases
  - Implement pattern detection

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Why only 39.1% solved?**  
A: Currently using pre-built solvers only. More synthesis strategies can improve this.

**Q: What about the other 60.9%?**  
A: They return zeros. You can:
- Add more program search strategies
- Use LLM-based approach (optional)
- Manually analyze and solve

**Q: Do I need GPU?**  
A: No! Training-based approach runs on CPU. Only LLM fallback needs GPU.

**Q: How long does training take?**  
A: ~5 minutes for all 1000 tasks on a modern CPU.

**Q: Can I improve the 39.1%?**  
A: Yes! See [TRAINING_README.md](TRAINING_README.md) for improvement strategies.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Error: "Module not found: dsl"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the ARC_DSL directory
cd ARC_DSL
python3 train_dsl_model.py
```

**Error: "Data directory not found"**
```bash
# Specify data path explicitly
python3 train_dsl_model.py --data-path /path/to/ARC-AGI-2-main/data
```

**Want to retrain?**
```bash
# Just run again (overwrites previous results)
python3 train_dsl_model.py --output new_trained_programs.json
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run training script
2. ✅ Check results (39.1% expected)
3. ✅ Generate submission
4. 📤 Upload to Kaggle
5. 🔄 Analyze failed tasks
6. 🚀 Implement improvements

## 📊 Expected Kaggle Score

- **Training tasks in evaluation**: 100% accuracy (if present)
- **New evaluation tasks**: Variable (depends on overlap)
- **Baseline established**: ~39% of trainable patterns

## 💪 Improving Performance

See improvement strategies:
1. Add more DSL function combinations
2. Implement object-based reasoning
3. Add pattern detection algorithms
