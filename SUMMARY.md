# Implementation Summary: LLM-Based DSL Solver for ARC-AGI-2

## What Was Created

This implementation provides a complete Jupyter notebook solution that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to search through and apply Domain Specific Language (DSL) programs to solve ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) tasks.

## Files Created

- Maintains access to 400 pre-built solvers

### LLM Architecture
The notebook supports multiple open-source models optimized for P100 GPU (16GB):

| Model | Size | Best For | Memory |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct | 7B | Reasoning tasks | ~7.5GB |
| Mistral-7B-Instruct | 7B | General purpose | ~14GB |
| Llama-2-7b-chat | 7B | Conversation | ~13GB |
| TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat | 1B | Fast inference | ~2.5GB |

### Prompt Engineering
The notebook creates structured prompts that:
1. Present task examples with grid dimensions
2. List available DSL operations
3. Guide step-by-step reasoning
4. Request formatted Python code output

### Execution Pipeline
```
ARC Task → LLM Analysis → Code Generation → DSL Execution → Validation
     ↓                                                            ↓

```

## Testing & Validation

All components tested successfully:
- ✅ ARC task loading from JSON files
- ✅ DSL module imports and function access
- ✅ DSL operation execution (vmirror, hmirror, etc.)
- ✅ Pre-built solver execution
- ✅ Notebook structure validation

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Results
- **Pre-built Solvers**: High accuracy (~99%+) on 400 known tasks
- **LLM-Generated**: Variable accuracy (10-50%) depending on task complexity
- **Hybrid Approach**: Best of both worlds

### Runtime Estimates (P100 GPU)
- Model download: 5-10 minutes (one-time)
- Initialization: 1-2 minutes
- Per task: 10-30 seconds
- 10 tasks: ~5-10 minutes
- 100 tasks: ~30-60 minutes
- Full dataset (1000 tasks): ~5-10 hours

## ARC-AGI-2 Specific Considerations

The notebook addresses the ARC-AGI-1 → ARC-AGI-2 transition:

### What's Included
1. **Pre-built solvers** for overlapping tasks
2. **Template functions** for new patterns:
   - Pattern detection
   - Symmetry analysis
   - Region operations
   - Color mapping
   - Grid interpolation

### Extensibility
The notebook provides a framework to add new DSL operations as needed:
```python
def extended_dsl_operations():
    def find_repeating_pattern(grid): ...
    def symmetry_detection(grid): ...
    def color_frequency_analysis(grid): ...
    # Add more as needed
```

## Kaggle Integration

### Path Variables for Easy Replacement
```python
DSL_MODULE_PATH = "./arc-dsl"              # Replace with Kaggle path
ARC_DATA_PATH = "./ARC-AGI-2-main/data"    # Replace with Kaggle path
TRAINING_DATA_PATH = f"{ARC_DATA_PATH}/training"
EVALUATION_DATA_PATH = f"{ARC_DATA_PATH}/evaluation"
LLM_MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"  # Swap models easily
```

### GPU Optimization
- Automatic device detection
- Float16 precision for memory efficiency
- Configurable batch sizes
- Memory-efficient model loading

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
1. Configure paths at top of notebook
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. View results in output cells
4. Generate submission file

### Advanced Usage
- Adjust temperature for more/less deterministic outputs
- Switch models for different accuracy/speed tradeoffs
- Add custom DSL functions for specific patterns
- Modify prompts for better task understanding
- Process in batches for efficiency

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. LLM accuracy varies by task complexity
2. Some generated code may have syntax errors
3. Memory constraints limit model size
4. Sequential processing (not parallelized)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Fine-tuning**: Train on ARC-specific tasks
2. **Ensemble**: Combine multiple LLM predictions
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use failed attempts to improve
4. **Pattern Library**: Build repository of successful patterns
5. **Multi-model**: Use different models for different task types
